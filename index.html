                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills,
                     and character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for 
                     example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of 
                     the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some 
                     researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.
                     These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                     term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, 
                     it can mean the academic field studying education.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The educational system in Nepal was long based on home-schooling
                     and gurukulas.[1] This was similar to the former Indian system of education, in which the pupils 
                     would learn either in their homes or with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic country, 
                     the general public had no access to formal education. The first formal school, Durbar High School, established by 
                     Jung Bahadur Rana in 1854, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms
                      to a more diverse population.[1] Education in Nepal from the primary school to the university level has been modeled
                       from the very inception on the Indian system, which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj.[2]Nepal 's 1971 
                       education plan hastened its development in the country.[citation needed] In around1952/54 Nepal had 10,000 students in
                        300 schools and an adult literacy rate of five percent.[citation needed] There were 49,000 schools in 2010,[citation needed] 
                        and by 2015 the overall adult literacy rate was 63.9 percent (males 76.4 percent and females 53.1 percent).[3] It has already 
                        been more than half-decade that public schools started imparting the education in the country.</p>
